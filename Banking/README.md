# End-to-End AI/ML Pipeline for Credit Risk and Fraud Detection in Banking

## 📌 Overview

This project implements an end-to-end AI/ML solution tailored for the banking sector. It focuses on solving two key challenges:
- **Credit Risk Prediction**: Assessing the likelihood of loan default using customer profile data.
- **Fraud Detection**: Identifying fraudulent transactions from financial activity patterns.

The solution pipeline includes data ingestion, preprocessing, feature engineering, model development, MLOps-based deployment, and performance monitoring.

## 🗃️ Datasets

1. **[Credit Risk Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/laotse/credit-risk-dataset)**  
   - Contains synthetic customer profile data with credit default labels.
2. **[Bank Transaction Fraud Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/valakhorasani/bank-transaction-dataset-for-fraud-detection)**  
   - Features transactional data labeled for fraudulent activity.
3. **[Banking Marketing Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prakharrathi25/banking-dataset-marketing-targets)**  
   - Supplementary data for customer segmentation and operational analytics.

## 🧠 Key Objectives

- Build robust machine learning models for classification (default, fraud).
- Perform advanced EDA and feature engineering on structured tabular data.
- Optimize models using ensemble methods and deep learning.
- Deploy models with full MLOps lifecycle: CI/CD, versioning, monitoring, and retraining.
- Explore use of NLP, time series, and RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) for potential extensions.
